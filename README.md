🧮 Java Console Calculator

A robust and user-friendly Command Line Calculator built in Java that performs basic arithmetic operations with proper input validation and exception handling.
This project demonstrates core Java concepts including loops, conditionals, switch statements, and exception handling.

📌 Features

Perform arithmetic operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/) with zero-division handling
Modulus (%)

Continuous execution using loop until user exits
Graceful handling of invalid input
Clean and structured console interaction

🛠 Tech Stack

Language: Java
Core Concepts Used:
while loop
switch statement
try-catch exception handling
Scanner class for user input

💻 Sample Execution
Press 1: Run Program
Press 0: Exit From Program

1
Enter First Number: 15
Enter Operator: + , - , * , / , % : /
Enter Second Number: 3
15.0/3.0 = 5.0

🧠 How It Works

The program runs inside an infinite loop.
User selects:
1 to perform calculation
0 to exit
Takes two floating-point numbers and an operator.
Uses a switch statement to determine the operation.
Uses try-catch to handle invalid inputs.
Prevents division by zero with validation logic.

🚀 Possible Enhancements

Implement a GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX
Add advanced mathematical operations
Maintain calculation history
Convert to a web-based calculator
